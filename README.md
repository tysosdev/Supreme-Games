# This is a modular version of supreme games.


The goal of this project is to provide an easy way of self hosting. The api things on upstream are confusing so I plan to remove or change anything dependent on it.

The games are in the `sg` folder.

I also aim to create something like emulatorjs.org code editor section that lets you select things that will combine into your sites files.

# How to self host
This repository is meant to act simply as a file server and uses other subdomains for proxy. To change the proxy, simply go to all occurences of `var proxURL =` and change it.
